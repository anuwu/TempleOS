# TempleOS

Experimenting with Terry Davis' Operating System. Note -
  - Distro version of my TempleOS state is in this repository
  - VMware machine state is in this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyP8FtCfoYNgSyR7uFNIs9abyLboDLPR/view?usp=sharing)
  - Codes that I develop will be put in `Home` directory
  - The `Misc` directory contains interesting stuff about TempleOS and Terry Davis (R.I.P)
  - The `TOSZ` directory contains the source code to convert HC.Z files to Linux/Windows compatible format. Compile and run!
  - The `Syntax` directory contains the .tmLanguage grammar file (credits to this [repository](https://github.com/codingdandy/holyc.tmbundle) by codingdandy), which can be linked to Atom for syntax highlighting. Check out this [link](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate/) for including HolyC syntax into atom.
