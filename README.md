# TempleOS

Experimenting with Terry Davis' Operating System. Note -
  - Distro version of my TempleOS state is in this repository
  - VMware machine state is in this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyP8FtCfoYNgSyR7uFNIs9abyLboDLPR/view?usp=sharing)
  - Codes that I develop will be put in `Home` directory
  - The `Misc` directory contains interesting stuff about TempleOS and Terry Davis (R.I.P)
  - The `TOSZ` directory contains the source code to convert HC.Z files to Linux/Windows compatible format. Compile and run!
  - The `language-HolyC` directory contains the grammar file which can be linked to Atom for syntax highlighting. `cd` into this directory and execute `apm init`
